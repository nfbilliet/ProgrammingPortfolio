====Integers====

Integers are a data type in computer science that are used to represent decimal numbers.
In the memory of the computer they are typically stored in 4 or more bytes (between 32 and 64 bits)

What is a variable?
    A named piece of memory that is used to store a specific type of data

Ways to initialize data
    1) unitiliazed variable, this is a variable that is not given any specific initial value.
       These variables will have a RANDOM initialization and often will contain garbage in the beginning

        dataType varName;

    2) zero initialization, initializes the variable with the 0 value

        dataType varName{};

    3) value initialization, specific value is given with the creation of the variable

        dataType varName {myValue};
        dataType varName = myValue;

    4) expression initialization, initial value is based on expression using predefined variables

        dataType varName1 = varValue1;
        dataType varName2 = varValue2;

        dataType varName3 = f(varName1, varName2), where f describes some function or expression using both variables
