# Programming Portfolio

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Niels Billiet and welcome to my personal github page. This programming portfolio is intended for two purposes 

1. Storing the code I have written for personal projects that I work on in my spare time
2. Displaying my coding skills to potential employers who are interested in my abilities and/or previous work

I *started programming* during my first year of university and immediately fell in love with the field. During and after my education I continued coding for research purposes and in my spare time. The languages that I am familiar with are 

- Python
- C++

which are also the ones being displayed in this portfolio. The code in both these languages can be found in their respective directories, i.e. python and cpp. Personally I have a big interest in computer graphics and 3D art which is something I also wish to combine with my love of programming.

## Python

Python is my main coding language and the one that I have the most experience working in. I have 3+ years of experience working in this language during my years as a researcher at the university of Ghent and for both my bachelor and master thesis during my studies. I have used this language to implement *quantum mechanical models*, which required me to focus on 

1. Matrix construction constrained by specific operator symmetries (e.g. commutational relations)
2. Construction of complete bitvector sets that fulfill specific conditions
3. Eigenspectrum calculation and visualtion 

###Quantum mechanical data###

In addition to this I also applied machine learning models to quantum mechanical data with the goal to analyse the learned patterns that were obtained during model optimization.

1. Generation of large datasets and storing these datasets in an efficient way
2. Building own library to create Dense Neural Networks (DNN) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN)
3. Analysis of model optimization and model performance
4. Interpretability of learned features

###Libraries###

As such I have experience with the following python libraries

1. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
2. [Scikit learn]()
3. [Keras]()
4. [Pytorch]()

My personal code from my time as a reasearcher can be found in the [gqcml](https://github.com/nfbilliet/ProgrammingPortfolio/tree/main/python/gqcml) subdirectory in the python directory. 

## C++

Currently I am in the process of learning C++ in my own private time. I already completed the C++ course on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus). In addition to this I am going through [The Modern C++ 20 Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-cpp-20-masterclass/)
